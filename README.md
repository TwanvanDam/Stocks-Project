# Stocks-Project
The structure of the Black Scholes and the Vector Model are implemented in Models.py 
- The two models contain the Euler and Milstein methods as functions in the class. BS also contains the exact solution as a method.
- Realisations can then be made by passing the initial conditions, a time array and a Wiener Process array of appropriate size.
  
There are files for every question:
- Question AB the methods are implemented in the file and the influence of the values for alpha and p are tested.
- Question C implements the strong convergence for BS
- Question D implements the weak convergence for BS
- Question E uses modified version of C and D to calculate strong and weak convergence for the vector model.
