The structure of the Black Scholes and the Vector Model are implemented in Models.py 
- The two models contain the Euler and Milstein methods as functions in the class
- Realisations can then be mad by passing the initial conditions, a time array and a Wiener Process array of appropriate size.
  
There are files for every question:
- In these files the specific Strong and Weak convergence is implemented.
